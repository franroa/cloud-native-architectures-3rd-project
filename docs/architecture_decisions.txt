Frontend to Person and Connection Services:
As this is an mvp, we don't strictly need to change the protocol used for the frontend: the number of calls to the
connection and person services are not expected to be so hugh, so we can stay with the RESTful protocol for that communication.

Location Service:
The location service will get information from the mobiles around, and will be ingesting a hugh amount of data,
so I would refactor two things here: I would use gRPC for the communication, which is able to process a higher
amount of data than RESTful can. Also I would decouple the calls inserting the data to the database for preventing
data congestion when writing data into the database.
